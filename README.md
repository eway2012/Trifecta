Trifecta
========

A combination of bejeweled and tetris.  Try to find sets of 3 or more of the same colored blocks as more and more blocks fall from the sky.  But hurry!  Your time is limited.  Scoring is exponential based on the number of blocks you explode at once.  The formula is n^2*100 where n represents the number of blocks.

Everything is done programatically so as to be easily customizable.  There is 1 variable that controls the number of columns.  That in turn determines the number of rows and the size of each block.
